## What is this?

A structured, machine-readable catalog of every documented technique for attacking AI systems. Each attack has an ID, name, category, description, severity rating, and mapping to industry frameworks (OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS).

This is the **what** — what attacks exist and how to defend against them. It does not include payloads, detection logic, or model-specific data.

This repository implements **Phases 1-3** of the [Evolutionary Security Framework (ESF)](https://github.com/tachyonicai/tachyonic-esf) — the open maturity model for progressively hardening AI security systems. See [ESF.md](ESF.md) for details.

## Why?

Most AI security discussions focus on a handful of well-known attacks. In reality, there are 122 distinct techniques across 11 categories. A system that blocks a naive instruction override might still fall to an encoding bypass, a multi-turn escalation, or an indirect injection through retrieved content.

This taxonomy gives you:

* **A checklist** — do your defenses cover all 11 categories?
* **A common language** — reference specific attack IDs (e.g., PI-007, JB-015) in security discussions
* **Framework mappings** — OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS for compliance and audits
* **Remediation guidance** — defensive strategies per category with code examples
* **ESF Phase 1-3 foundation** — the naming, relating, and initial heuristics that all downstream hardening depends on

## Attack Categories

| Category | ID Prefix | Count | OWASP LLM Top 10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt Injection | PI | 20 | LLM01 |
| System Prompt Leakage | SPL | 12 | LLM07 |
| Jailbreaks | JB | 22 | LLM01 |
| Vision/Multimodal | VI | 12 | LLM01 |
| Excessive Agency / Tool Abuse | EA | 12 | LLM06 |
| Multi-Turn Manipulation | MT | 8 | LLM01 |
| Sensitive Information Disclosure | SID | 10 | LLM06 |
| Supply Chain | SC | 8 | LLM03 |
| Vector/Embedding Attacks | VE | 8 | LLM08 |
| Improper Output Handling | IOH | 8 | LLM05 |
| Unbounded Consumption | UC | 2 | LLM10 |
| **Total** |  | **122** |  |

## Quick Start

### Browse the taxonomy

```yaml
# taxonomy/attack_catalog.yaml
- id: PI-001
  name: Direct Instruction Override
  category: prompt_injection
  description: >
    Attacker provides input that directly instructs the model to ignore
    its system prompt and follow new instructions instead.
  severity: critical
  owasp: LLM01
```

### Use in your security assessments

1. Clone the repo
2. Review `taxonomy/attack_catalog.yaml` for the full attack surface
3. Check `remediation/by_owasp.yaml` for defensive guidance
4. Use the schema in `schema/attack_schema.yaml` to add your own attack definitions

### Map to compliance frameworks

```yaml
# taxonomy/owasp_mapping.yaml
LLM01_prompt_injection:
  attacks: [PI-001, PI-002, ..., PI-020, MT-001, ..., MT-008]
  total: 28
  description: Direct and indirect prompt injection techniques
```

### Assess your maturity

Use the [ESF Quick Start](https://github.com/tachyonicai/tachyonic-esf/blob/main/guides/quick-start.md) to score your system against the ten-phase maturity model. This taxonomy provides the foundation for Phases 1-3.

## Evolutionary Security Framework (ESF)

This repository is the **Phases 1-3 reference implementation** of the [ESF](https://github.com/tachyonicai/tachyonic-esf).

The ESF defines how security knowledge matures through ten phases — from naming threats (Phase 1, this repo) to mathematically proving defenses (Phase 9). OWASP tells you *what* the risks are. The ESF tells you *how to progressively harden* against them.

| ESF Phase | This Repo | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: **Name** | `taxonomy/` | Classifies 122 attacks with stable IDs and framework mappings |
| Phase 2: **Relate** | `taxonomy/*_mapping.yaml` | Maps relationships to OWASP and MITRE ATLAS |
| Phase 3: **Guess** | `remediation/` | Defensive heuristics and code examples |

See [ESF.md](ESF.md) for the full mapping and growth roadmap.

## What's NOT included

This taxonomy deliberately excludes:

* **Attack payloads** — the specific prompts/content that execute attacks
* **Detection logic** — how to identify if an attack succeeded
* **Model-specific success rates** — which attacks work against which models
* **Confidence scoring** — how to rate vulnerability severity programmatically

These are the difference between knowing attacks exist and being able to systematically test for them.

## Contributing
